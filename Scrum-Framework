Scrum Process:
=======================
Scrum is a framework using which we build the software using the Agile process
It is a framework within which people or team address complex requirements, while productively and creatively delivering the product at faster velocity

A Scrum framework consists of:
================================
1. Scrum Team 
  > Product Owner
        -> gathers requirements from the client or stakeholders
        -> Manages the product backlog and make sure it is available to Scrum team, stakeholder
        -> Knows what is in the backlog and in which order there by providing transparency to all
  > Scrum Master
       -> Scrum master is not the leader but he is COACH or a guide to the organization on implementing Scrum theory, process and principles.
  	-> Helps Product owner, scrum team as well the organiztion how scrum can be used to help in accomplishing the Goals

  > Development team: includes developers and testers
	-> build the actual product
	-> they demostrate the build 


2. Scrum Events:
======================
     > Sprint Planning:
	======================
          > Its a meethign attended by all scrum team memebers
	  > total time for sprint planning in a sprint is 8 hours ==> 2hours/week  
	  > determins what we can deliver in the sprint
	  > plan how to achieve this delivery
	  > the team crafts the goal of this sprint
 	  > A high level objective of the sprint is decided in this meeting by selecting user stories from the product backlog
	  > For every sprint we have -> Sprint backlog
	  > dev and team team will also provide rough estimates of how long user stores willt ake to complete
 	  > this effort is given in the form of fibonacci series
    
		0, 1,1,2,3,5,8 ...
	dev : 5 ==> could mean anything => 5 hours  or 5 days(6 hours/day)
	tester: 3 ==> means ==> 3 hours  or 3 days to compete the testing

     > Sprint : Iteration - 2-4 weeks of time
	======================
	-> where the scrum team will pickup a user story and build it
        -> Development and testing work together
     > Daily Scrum Call : Scrum team developer and tester will meet togther everyday for min 15 mins
	===============
		> Inspect the sprtint plan and discuss if any changes needed
		> Blocker issues
                > what will be done next
                > What did I complete yesterday? , What is my plan for today?, What are the impediments to my work?
     > Sprint Review:
=================================
        > Goal : Inspect the product increment/sprint
        > Adapt the product backlog
	> Attended by stakeholders + scrum team
         > TimeBox -> 4hours/sprint
        > deveopers will demostrate prodcut developed
        > stakholders will give a feedback on new changes
	> update the backlog as per the feedback for suggested new changes
    > Scrum Retrospective Meeting:
======================================
	> Final event of the sprint
	> Happens after the sprint review meeting   
	> help the scrum team to conticnously imporeve thier approch of the work sprint after a sprint 
	> time Boxed for 3 hours/Sprint
        > we discuss -> the process that went well
	> opportunities for improvement
	> how they new improvements will be rolled out => Improvement plan
	

3. Scrum Artefacts

     > Product Backlog
               > Description about the feature to be build
               > estimation and story points
               > is constantly evolving and is updated by the scrum team and is led by product owner

     > Epic: A collection of user stories
     > User story : small requirements to be build
     > Sprint backlog: 
              > maintained by product owner
              > what user storeis will be part of the sprint
